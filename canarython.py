## This Python code was not tested, but it should create a canary file in the current working directory, and then periodically check for its presence and for any modifications to ## the file. If the canary file is not present, a message is printed to the output indicating that the canary file has not been detected. If the canary file ## is present, a message is printed to the output indicating that the canary file has been detected, and the script also checks for any modifications to the ## file. If a modification is detected, a message is printed to the output indicating this. The script also checks for any network communications that might ## be attempting to exfiltrate the canary file, and prints a message to the output if such activity is detected.
