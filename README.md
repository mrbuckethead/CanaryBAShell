# CanaryBAShell
A powershell and a bash script that creates a canary file in the temp directory and then periodically checks for its presence, and detect any modifications

In PowerShell, you can check if a script will run by using the Test-Path cmdlet to check if the script file exists and is readable, and then using the Get-Content cmdlet to check if the script file has any syntax errors.

# Set the path to the script file
$script_path = "C:\path\to\script.ps1"

# Check if the script file exists and is readable
if (Test-Path $script_path -PathType Leaf) {
  # Check the script file for syntax errors
  $script_content = Get-Content $script_path -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

  if ($?) {
    # No syntax errors were found
    Write-Output "Script file is ready to run: $script_path"
  } else {
    # Syntax errors were found
    Write-Output "Script file has syntax errors: $script_path"
  }
} else {
  # The script file does not exist or is not readable
  Write-Output "Script file not found or not readable: $script_path"
}

his script first uses the Test-Path cmdlet to check if the script file exists and is readable. If the file exists and is readable, it uses the Get-Content cmdlet to read the contents of the file. The -ErrorAction parameter is set to SilentlyContinue to suppress any error messages that might be generated if the file has syntax errors.

If the Get-Content cmdlet is successful, it means that the script file does not have any syntax errors, and a message is written to the output indicating that the script is ready to run. If the Get-Content cmdlet generates an error, it means that the script file has syntax errors, and a message is written to the output indicating this.

If the script file does not exist or is not readable, a message is written to the output indicating this.

Here is an example of how you can do this:

To check if a bash script will run, you can try running it using the bash command followed by the path to the script file. For example:
bash /path/to/script.sh

If the script is executable and does not have any syntax errors, it should run without any issues.

Alternatively, you can use the bash -n option to check the script for syntax errors without actually running it. For example:
bash -n /path/to/script.sh

If the script has any syntax errors, the bash command will print an error message indicating the line number and the nature of the error.

You can also make the script executable by changing its permissions using the chmod command, and then running it by simply specifying the path to the script file:
chmod +x /path/to/script.sh
/path/to/script.sh

This method is useful if you want to run the script multiple times and don't want to specify the bash command every time.
